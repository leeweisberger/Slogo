Design Goals

Describe the goals of your project's design (i.e., what you want to make flexible and what assumptions you may need to make) by breaking it into modules. A module is a concept in your program that may be represented by a single class or a group of classes related in some standard way, such as set of subclasses, that has a purpose with regards to the program's functionality and collaborates with other modules.

Primary Classes and Methods

Describe the program's core architecture (focus on behavior not state), including pictures of a UML diagram to describe the Model and "screen shots" of your intended View interface
Example code (this is especially important in helping others understand how to use your API)
Show actual code that implements the following use case: "The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, and sees the turtle move in the display window leaving a trail." It should be clear from this code which objects are responsible for completing each part of the task, but you do not have to implement the called functions.

Explain some alternatives to your design, and why you choose the one you did
List of each team member's role in the project and a breakdown of what each person is expected to work on.
