Need to create formatted textFields to show information about variables, and such:

Pair Program: paint slower (with sleep or timer)


Delegation:
Steve: 

1. Access Map: In display we have already passed in model, and so write an getter that get it. 

3. Figure out dynamically the window size (componentSize)
4. Flag to drawUpdateState (default state is that )
5. Allow multiple workspaces (perhaps as tabs or as separate windows). 
	You can define exactly what a workspace is but, at the very least, 
	it should have a separate turtle display area, command history, and active variables
6. Multiple Turtle Drawing: 
	allow users to toggle whether or not to highlight the currently active turtles in a workspace's display window
		Terrapin Logo v. 3 allows you to make the WHO command visible by having boundary boxes appear around all objects on the TELL list. 
		This can be useful when using multiple turtles or multiple bitmaps so that the objects that are listening to commands are readily apparent.

****Notes
MenuBar refactored but still doesn't obey open closed principle
