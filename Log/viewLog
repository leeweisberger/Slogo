enter commands to the turtle interactively
display results of the turtle executing commands
The turtle should be driven via commands entered by the user 
and optionally by buttons or other user controls.
 
You should provide feedback so that the user is always aware 
of the turtle's position, heading, or other parameters affected
by the environment. Note, the turtle starts in the center of the 
display which is considered (0, 0).

display errors that may result from the user's commands

choose an image to use for the turtle

specify a color to use for the pen
show commands previously run in the environment (even better, make these commands directly clickable to execute)
access an HTML formatted help page
it could just be a "language reference", i.e., the command descriptions
given with the assignment, or you could extend it to include features of the GUI
